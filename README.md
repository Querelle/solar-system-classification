## Overview

This project is only intended to clarify some of the most common properties of Angular.

## Main structure:

### Page

This is the intelligent component, which receives the business data
from the HTTP service and forwards the useful output to the child components.
It intercepts the events generated by the child components and decides which service method to call.

### Component

This is the dumb component, it graphically renders the data received from the parent component
and dispatches actions (e.g., clicks)
